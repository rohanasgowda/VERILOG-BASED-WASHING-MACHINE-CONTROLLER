# Verilog-Based Washing Machine Controller

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Washing Machine Controller** using **Verilog HDL**. The system simulates the washing process including water fill, wash, rinse, and spin cycles. It is designed for FPGA implementation and demonstrates sequential control using **finite state machines (FSM)**.

## ⚙️ Features
1. **Water Fill Cycle:** Fills the tank to a predefined level.  
2. **Wash Cycle:** Simulates washing action for a set duration.  
3. **Rinse Cycle:** Drains and refills water for rinsing clothes.  
4. **Spin Cycle:** Activates motor for drying clothes.  
5. **User Inputs:** Start, Stop, and Reset controls.  
6. **Display Outputs:** LEDs or 7-segment display to indicate current cycle.
